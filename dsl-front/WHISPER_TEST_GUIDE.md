## Expected Behavior

### First Time Use
- ‚úÖ Shows "Initializing Whisper AI..." with progress bar
- ‚úÖ Downloads ~39MB Whisper model (one-time only)
- ‚úÖ Model is cached for future use
- ‚úÖ Ready to record after initialization

### Recording Process
- ‚úÖ "Start Recording" button starts audio capture

- ‚úÖ "Stop Recording" button stops capture and starts transcription
- ‚úÖ Shows "Transcribing your audio with Whisper AI..." with progress
- ‚úÖ Displays final transcribed text
- ‚úÖ Auto-sends transcribed text to chat backend

### Audio Quality
- ‚úÖ Records at 44.1kHz sample rate

- ‚úÖ Supports WebM audio format with Opus codec

## Troubleshooting

### If "Initializing Whisper AI..." gets stuck:
- Check internet connection (model download required)
- Check browser console for error messages
- Try refreshing the page
- Ensure sufficient disk space (~50MB for model)

### If recording doesn't start:
- Grant microphone permissions when prompted
- Check browser microphone settings
- Try a different browser (Chrome works best)
- Ensure HTTPS in production

### If transcription fails:
- Check browser console for detailed error messages
- Ensure clear audio input (speak clearly and close to microphone)
- Try shorter recordings (under 30 seconds)
- Check that Whisper model downloaded successfully

### If transcription is inaccurate:
- Speak more clearly and slowly
- Reduce background noise
- Use a better microphone
- Try the quick voice input (üé§ button) as alternative

## Browser Compatibility

- ‚úÖ **Firefox**: Full support
- ‚úÖ **Edge**: Full support
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Safari**: Limited support (may have restrictions)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Mobile**: Supported but may be slower

## Performance Notes

- **First Use**: 30-60 seconds for model download
- **Subsequent Uses**: Immediate startup (model cached)
- **Transcription Time**: 2-5 seconds for typical messages
- **Memory Usage**: ~100-200MB during transcription

## Debug Information

Open browser console (F12) to see:

## Test Scenarios

### Basic Functionality
1. Record a simple greeting: "Hello, how are you?"
2. Record a longer message: "I need to schedule an oil change for my car next week"
3. Record with background noise to test quality

### Error Handling
1. Try recording without microphone permission
2. Try recording with poor internet connection
3. Try very short recordings (< 1 second)
4. Try very long recordings (> 2 minutes)

### Integration Testing
1. Verify transcribed text appears in chat
2. Verify chat backend receives the message
3. Test with different conversation contexts
4. Test multiple consecutive recordings

## Success Criteria

- ‚úÖ Whisper model downloads and initializes successfully
- ‚úÖ Audio recording starts and stops properly
- ‚úÖ Transcription produces accurate text
- ‚úÖ Transcribed text auto-sends to chat
- ‚úÖ Error handling works gracefully
- ‚úÖ Performance is acceptable (< 10 seconds total)

## Known Limitations

- Requires internet connection for initial model download
- Model size is ~39MB (one-time download)
- Transcription accuracy depends on audio quality
- Processing time increases with longer recordings
- Some browsers may have restrictions on Web Workers
